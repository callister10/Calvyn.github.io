					<div class="coding-skills">
						<h1>Skills</h1>
						<div class="Skill_1">
							<h3>Python</h3>
							<p>
								As my first programming language, I am most experienced in
								Python. I am knowledgable with concepts such as simple data
								structures (dictionaries, lists, tuples), list comprehension,
								functions, error handling and object oriented programming. I
								hope to continue improving my Python knowledge by applying it to
								more projects and branching out further. I plan to learn OpenCV
								and Django in the future.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="Skill_2">
							<h3>Front end development</h3>
							<p>
								git Currently working to improve my web development skills by
								applying them. I enjoy creating and developing visual interfaces
								that are functional, responsive and interactive. My current
								experience involves HTML/CSS and SCSS. I plan to further develop
								my understanding of this field by learning Javascript and React,
								as well as use Figma to help better visualize UX/UI designs and
								design wireframes.
							</p>
						</div>
						<div class="Skill_3">
							<h3>Other tools</h3>
							<p>
								Experienced with Microsoft Office tools, particularly Excel,
								Word and Powerpoint. I have learned different intermediate Excel
								techniques such as flash fill, pivot tables, goal seeking,
								conditional formatting, index and matching as well as
								forecasting. Knowledgeable with Matlab by applying it in
								numerous school labs, as well as Git/Github by using it
								regularly to update my repositories. I also have some experience
								with SQL after taking a course on it, involving basic CRUD
								syntax. I currently use VS code editor, due to it's versatility.
							</p>
						</div>
					</div>
					<div class="Future_plan">
						<div class="Skill_4">I plan to also learn Java soon!</div>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="Project">
					<h1>Projects</h1>
					<div class="Project_1">
						<h3>Automated control system for Robotic Arm</h3>
						<p>
							Utilised Python to design an program to transport surgical tools
							into autoclaves, based on user-input with muscle sensors in a
							virtual environment. Automated to be capable of transporting
							varying containers of different sizes and colors in a randomized
							order.
						</p>
					</div>
					<div class="Project_2">
						<h3>Personal Website</h3>
						<p>
							Created with HTML/CSS, compiled with SCSS and currently going
							throught further iterations to increase functionality and apply my
							web-development knowledge. Layout was formatted with both CSS grid
							and flexbox, with transitions and responsive media queries
							applied. I plan to also improve it with vanilla Javascript and
							React.
